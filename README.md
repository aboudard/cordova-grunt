cordova-grunt
=============

Cordova grunt script to clean and copy images

When you have a cordova project, some folders and image files are :
- irrelevant
- not generated

Icons are only generated with Phonegap Build.

The reference file structure this script is based on can be found here : https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-start
The script is all about copying icons.
A clean task was added to remove a scss folder (considering you work with Ionic UI framework).

You mus build your cordova project BEFORE you run the grunt command.
